The knowledge of high mortality rate disease clusters can enable healthcare providers and patients to be proactive and develop tailored interventions that improve patient outcomes. In this paper, we consider two closely related problems of  finding a small clique of comorbid diseases that corresponds to the highest mortality rate among a given patient population, and finding an incrementally larger clique of diseases containing a given clique of diseases with the highest marginal mortality rate. To tackle these problems, we explore two approaches (i) a mixed integer programming formulation that maximizes a single fractional objective subject to linear constraints, and (ii) an extension of the classical Bron--Kerbosch enumerative algorithm. We conduct a detailed  computational  study and report results from our experiments with both approaches on  datasets derived from   10.6 million de-identified patient electronic health records.","tags":null,"title":"Identifying Most Lethal Cliques in Disease Comorbidity Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hao Pan","Yajun Lu","Balabhaskar Balasundaram","Juan S.

The $k$-club model, which relaxes the requirement of pairwise adjacency in a clique to length-bound-ed paths inside the cluster, has been used to model cohesive subgroups in social networks and functional modules or complexes in biological networks. However, if the graphs are time-varying, or if they change under different conditions, we may be interested in clusters that preserve their property over time or under changes in conditions. To model such  clusters that are conserved in a collection of graphs, we consider a cross-graph $k$-club model, a subset of nodes that forms a $k$-club in every graph in the collection. In this paper, we consider the canonical optimization problem of finding a cross-graph $k$-club of maximum cardinality in a graph collection.   We develop  integer programming approaches to solve this problem. Specifically, we introduce strengthened formulations, valid inequalities, and branch-and-cut algorithms based on delayed constraint generation. The results of our computational study indicate the significant benefits of using the approaches we introduce.","tags":null,"title":"Finding Conserved Low-Diameter Subgraphs in  Social and Biological Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yajun Lu","Thanh Duong","Zhuqi Miao","Thanh Thieu","Jivan Lamichhane","Abdulaziz Ahmed","Dursun Delen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1720224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1720224000,"objectID":"df233b2311daf50ab21aa678c6866259","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/2021-2025/risk-score-2024/","publishdate":"2024-07-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-2025/risk-score-2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Disease risk scores are vital for patient stratification and resource allocation. Existing scoring approaches often complicate score scales. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hyperparameter search technique to simplify the scores while maintaining high accuracy. **Materials and Methods** The risk scores, generated by our proposed technique in conjunction with different predictor discretization methods, were applied to case studies of predicting diabetic retinopathy (DR) and hip fracture readmission (HFR) for evaluation. Our cohorts involved 97,876 diabetic patients, including 3,749 with DR, and 18,065 hip fracture patients, with 2,055 readmitted within 30 days. **Results** Our scores achieve accuracies insignificantly different from those obtained by existing approaches, up to an AUC of 0.814 (varied depended on the predictor discretization methods used) for DR prediction and up to 0.638 for HFR prediction. Regarding the scale, our scores range from 0 to a maximum of 42 for DR and 0 to a maximum of 10 for HFR, while the risk scores produced by other methods often span till hundreds or thousands. **Discussion** The case studies focusing on DR and HFR predictions demonstrate that our approach can potentially serve as a general framework for developing simpler and  accurate risk scores for disease prediction. Furthermore, our new DR risk score system can be a competitive alternative to the state-of-the-art DR risk score. While our HFR case study presents the first risk score for this condition. **Conclusion** Our novel hyperparameter search approach yields simple and accurate risk scores, fostering ease of use for healthcare professionals in risk stratification.","tags":null,"title":"A Novel Hyperparameter Search Approach for Accuracy and Simplicity in Disease Prediction Risk Scoring","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Course Description: This course provides students with an introduction to analytic and quantitative methods for business decision making.

Informally, an atomic clique is a clique that is unsplittable over time—the clique is either present or absent entirely and no parts of it appears in the temporal graph unless the entire clique is present.

Our main contribution is a polynomial-time algorithm that transforms the maximum atomic clique problem to the maximum clique problem on an auxiliary graph. We report results from our computational studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of this transformation in solving the maximum atomic clique problem in comparison to direct integer programming based approaches.

One such model is the $s$-club, which is a vertex subset that induces a subgraph of diameter at most $s$. This model has found use in a variety of fields because  low-diameter clusters have practical significance  in many applications. As this property is not hereditary on vertex-induced subgraphs, the diameter of a subgraph could increase upon the removal of some vertices and  the subgraph could even become disconnected. For example, star graphs have  diameter  two but can be disconnected by removing the central vertex. The pursuit of a fault-tolerant extension of the $s$-club model has  spawned  two variants that we study in this article: robust $s$-clubs  and hereditary $s$-clubs. We analyze the complexity of the  verification and optimization problems associated with these variants. Then, we propose cut-like integer programming formulations for both variants whenever possible and investigate the separation complexity of the cut-like constraints.  We demonstrate through our extensive computational experiments that the algorithmic ideas we introduce  enable us to solve the problems to optimality on benchmark instances with several thousand vertices.

You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!
