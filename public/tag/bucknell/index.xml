&lt;p&gt;Almost any managerial decision includes (or should include) a component of analysis using quantitative models. The fields of Management Science/Operations Research/Business Analytics are focused on the development and application of methods for quantitative decision making. These tools have dramatically changed the way business operates in service operations, manufacturing, marketing, and finance (not to mention transportation, sports insurance, etc.). This course will introduce some fundamental techniques for data analysis and decision making under uncertainty. We will focus on thinking structurally about decision problems with the goals of enhancing decision-making skills and managerial insight. Moreover, we will use Microsoft Excel to solve problems and draw insights from data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;learning-goals&#34;&gt;Learning Goals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recognize and relate practical issues with business analytics (Synthesis skills).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply business analytics to make sense of data for making decisions (Quantitative). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formulate decision models for evaluating or developing strategies (Quantitative, technological skills). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The world of business is increasingly recognizing the strategic importance of the production and service functions as sources of major competitive strength.

This course will introduce you to the operational challenges that managers encounter and provide a set of tools to aid you in designing and managing processes in the real world. We will discuss quantitative approaches to operations and supply chain management to deal with the inherent uncertainty of the business place.  Using these approaches, you will develop the ability to recognize, formulate, and analyze operations and supply chain management decisions in many different contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
