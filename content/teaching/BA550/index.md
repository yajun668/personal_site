### Course Description:
Supply chain analytics is one of the fastest-growing business intelligence application areas. Every day supply chains create a vast amount of data. Every transaction, every operation, every claim is often recorded and saved as data. This course showcases real-life applications of data analytics  in various fields of supply chain management, such as forecasting and inventory management, sales and operations planning, production, transportation, logistics and fulfillment, purchasing and supply management, etc. in manufacturing, trade and service industries. Students will learn real-life examples of how analytics can be applied to these domains of a supply chain to generate a significant social/economic impact. Topics include demand forecasting for new products, supply chain design, transportation analytics, sales and operations analytics in production, inventory management, simulation, and  applying analytics to big data in  supply chain management. Software packages such as Excel/Excel Solver and/or R will be utilized to help in solving models.
